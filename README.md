Final Project for GE106 / SUSTech

*Description*:
1. A ticket booking system with administer, passenger account.
2. The adminster can create or modify the flight, and search the information of the flight.
3. The passenger can search for the ticket and book the ticket.

*More to Say*:
1.The first step of the plan contains only modification on the commandline.
2.There may be second step will require advanced technique like sql, CSS, html and javascript.
3.The whole program is based on java, because after all, it's a java class( though I would really prefer using python or even matlab )
